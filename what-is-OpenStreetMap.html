<h1>What is OpenStreetMap?</h1>

<p>OpenStreetMap is a map created by people across the world. Everybody is mapping what is interesting or important for them. It may be nearly anything - from forests through roads and museums to shops. People map buildings, hiking routes, tourism attractions, rocks and fire hydrants.</p>

<p>Collected data can be used by anyone, as long as OpenStreetMap contributors are credited and data stays open. It may be used for making maps, from usual to ones that show some specific data like hiking
routes, railway info, public transport routes. Special projects included maps for blind people, art projects and games. Some maps are used by
humanitarian organisations in places where official data is unavailable or of low quality.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap data is also useful for other projects - route finding, making city models in flight simulators, flood preparation planning.</p>

<p>To be more exact OpenStreetMap is not a map - people editing are not directly creating map ("this area should be in brown colour to represent a building here" or "here should be a blue line to represent a motorway") but rather collecting data ("this area is a residential building" or "here is a motorway with 3 lanes in each direction with road code A7").</p>

<p>This data may be presented in many ways see below for example. All map styles use OpenStreetMap data but in different ways</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap data is frequently used instead of official government data that is often unavailable without special permissions, fees. In addition official data is often outdated, incomplete or hard to process.</p>

<p>OpenStreetMap project website is at <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a>.</p>
