            <ul>
                <li>Move map to a small area interesting for you (a single crossing will work, generating map of Poland will fail).</li>
                <li>Press the "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
                <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no real progress info is displayed during download. Not even progress bar animation is whown when map is generated in your browser, it may take a bit.</li>
                <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>

        <p>Map style is generating SVG design files for ue in laset cutter. As orientation maps for blind people of a very small area, such as a single road crossing.</p>
        <p>laser parameters that I used are given, but this is a solely example! You will need to test it on laser cutter you use which parameters are optimal. Yes, it is time consuming</p>
        <p>
            It generates a single SVG that is intended to be used for multiple cuts:
            <ol>
                <li>separate cut, splitting road surface with own pattern and everything else (separate colours for cut lines around entire area and for engraving) - engraving was 400 speed 40 power 0.08 line interval on my laser.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This allows easy painting of the road area - otherwise paint will travel within plywood
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>separate cuts of footway areas and crossing - I cut them into plexiglass to achive clearly different surface in touch. I considered using leather or cork. For transparent plexiglass it is possible to spray-paint its bottom to change it colour to a desired one</li>
                <p>separate cut for buildings, I used two layers of thick plywood to make it clearly distinct</p>
                <p>separate cut for steps. This is a a quite tricky layer: first of all <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:area:highway%3Dsteps">area:highway</a> is processed and split into symbolic areas</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>outer shape surrounding entire steps area: should cut through to produce a separate piece</li>
                    <li>symbolic steps - should be engraved as areas with increasing power. On my specific laser following worked
                        <ol>
                            <li>20% power, 1 repetition, line interval 0.08mm</li>
                            <li>MAX power (80% on this specific laser), 1 repetitions, line interval 0.08mm</li>
                            <li>MAX power, 2 repetitions, line interval 0.08mm</li>
                            <li>MAX power, 3 repetitions, line interval 0.08mm</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

        <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>
