                <li>Press the "rectangle" button, select interesting area for you.</li>
                <li>Wait - waiting several seconds is normal, currently no progress info is displayed.</li>
                <li>Generated map should appear below map used for selecting, download should be also automatically triggered. There is also download button available below generated map image.</li>
                <li>Use this for something!</li>
            </ul>
        </p>      
        <p>Map style has support for areas such as buildings, water, parks, forests, road areas and linear features such as roads, railways, waterways, taxiway, runways. Produced SVG files can be downloaded.</p>

        <p>Have fun with using OpenStreetMap data for interesting and/or useful purposes! Just remember that you must mention source of data in way visible to whoever will be using it. See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">this page</a> for details, including cases where it is legally allowed to avoid giving a clear credit (but I encourage to do this in all cases).</p>
